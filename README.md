# project_Arrangem
The project “ARRANGEM” aims to automate the process of sorting gems (or any small food article) based on colors. 
The sorting is done as per need and application.
Color sorter basically separates items by their colors, detecting the colors of things that pass before them, 
and using mechanical or pneumatic ejection devices to divert items whose colors do not fall within the acceptable range.
